# CORONA VIRUS WORLD DATA
Data Analytics Project

CORONA VIRUS CASES WORLD DATA - DATA VISUALIZATION:

This project focuses on tracking the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and helps us visualize the areas affected by the virus around the globe. Tracking the COVID-19 spread enables us to understand the seriousness of the current situation. The global pandemic can be visualized using various types of plots/charts. The visualizations enable people to understand the data more quickly. We have used various techniques and color schemes to develop Coronavirus Dashboard to help visualize available data in an informative way.

DATA:

Data acquisition is the process of fetching the data from a source to our system. We used R for data acquisition from two different sources. The data for the Coronavirus Dashboard is taken from the below sources:
•	Covid19.analytics (R package)
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covid19.analytics/vignettes/covid19.analytics.html
•	The New York Times (Github repository)
